## Introduction ## 
The source codes for "ST-ReGE: A Novel Spatial-Temporal Residual Graph Convolutional Network for CVD"  
The model.py only include the backbone for 300 nodes case and the way to construct graph-based ECG data.  
The other cases (10, 120, 600, 1200 nodes) are included in other_models
